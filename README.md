## LTSPICE SIMULATIONS

A list of different Electrical components design in LTSPICE. Contains supporting theory material in PDF formats and code in Python for automated design calculations.

**WARNIGN**: This repository is aimed at practical designs and does not go deep into theory and derivations.

List of devices:
- **BJT Amplifiers**: Amplifier design in common emitter, base and collector configurations
- **Op-Amp circuits**: 
- **Converters**: Buck, Boost and Buck-boost converter design.
